# python-learning

Here, I track my progress as I get myself used to the Python programming language. While I have a solid background in C++, my focus is on mastering Python syntax and its unique features.

## Resources Used

- **W3Schools**: For fundamental concepts and practical examples.
- **Codecademy**: For interactive lessons and real-world projects.
- **roadmap.sh**: To follow a structured learning path.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a journal of my learning process. I'll document everything I encounter, from basic exercises to more complex projects. My goal is to thoroughly understand Python syntax and apply it effectively.
