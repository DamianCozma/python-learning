# Coffee Chatbot Project

## Overview
The Coffee Chatbot is a Python-based project designed to automate the coffee ordering process. It interacts with users to take their coffee orders in advance, helping to reduce wait times typically experienced during coffee runs.

## Features
- Greets users and prompts them for their coffee order details.
- Allows users to select the size of their drink.
- Offers a selection of drink types, including Brewed Coffee, Mocha, and Latte.
- For Lattes, users can choose the type of milk they prefer.
- Utilizes recursive functions to handle invalid inputs gracefully, ensuring users select from the available options.
- Collects the user's name to personalize the order completion message.

## How It Works
1. **Greeting**: The chatbot welcomes the user to the cafe.
2. **Select Drink Size**: The user is prompted to choose a drink size (Small, Medium, Large).
3. **Select Drink Type**: The user selects their desired drink type.
4. **Customize Latte (if selected)**: If the user chooses a Latte, they are asked to select the type of milk.
5. **Order Summary**: The chatbot summarizes the order and asks for the user's name.
6. **Completion Message**: The user is thanked by name, and informed their drink will be ready shortly.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Input/Output for interaction
- Conditional statements and recursion for decision-making and input validation
