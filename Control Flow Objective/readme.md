# Magic 8-Ball Project

The Magic 8-Ball, a popular toy from the 1950s known for fortune-telling or seeking advice, inspired this Python program. By asking a "Yes" or "No" question, users receive varied fortunes upon each execution.

## Features

- **Dynamic Fortunes**: Utilizes Python's `random` module to generate random outcomes, ensuring a different answer for each run.
- **Customizable Queries**: Users can input their name and question, making each interaction unique.
- **Control Flow Implementation**: Employs `if`/`elif`/`else` statements to map random numbers to specific fortunes.

## Possible Fortunes

1. Yes - definitely
2. It is decidedly so
3. Without a doubt
4. Reply hazy, try again
5. Ask again later
6. Better not tell you now
7. My sources say no
8. Outlook not so good
9. Very doubtful
