# Hacking The Fender Project

The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire access to The Fender's systems, you must update his "passwords.csv" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.

Use your knowledge of working with Python files to retrieve, manipulate, obscure, and create data in your quest for justice. Work with CSV files and other text files in this exploration of the strength of Python file programming.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Import and parse data from a CSV file to identify compromised users.
- **File Manipulation**: Create and write to text and JSON files to store and communicate the results of the data retrieval.
- **Data Obfuscation**: Update a CSV file with a signature to obscure the true nature of the data manipulation.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Reading In The Passwords**: Import the CSV module, create a list of compromised users, read in the "passwords.csv" file, and store the compromised usernames.
2. **Notifying the Boss**: Use the JSON module to create and write a message to a JSON file, notifying the completion of the mission.
3. **Scrambling the Password**: Write a signature to a new CSV file to replace the original "passwords.csv", effectively scrambling the data.
