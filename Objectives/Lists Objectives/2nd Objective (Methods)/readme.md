# Len's Slice Project

The Len's Slice project is a hands-on Python exercise focusing on lists, designed to simulate the management of a pizza shop's sales data. It provides practical experience with organizing and manipulating data through creating, sorting, slicing, and modifying lists.

## Objective

To manage pizza types and their prices using Python lists, demonstrating proficiency in list operations and data manipulation.

## Key Features

- **List Creation**: Initiates lists to store pizza toppings and their corresponding prices.
- **Two-Dimensional List**: Combines pizza toppings and prices into a two-dimensional list, forming a comprehensive menu.
- **Menu Modification**: Includes adding new pizza types, adjusting prices based on cost changes, and removing items from the menu.
- **Price Analysis**: Sorts and slices the menu to identify the cheapest and most expensive options available.

## Core Tasks

1. Create separate lists for pizza toppings and prices.
2. Form a menu by combining these lists into a two-dimensional structure.
3. Modify the menu by:
   - Adding new pizza types and their prices.
   - Adjusting prices as necessary.
   - Removing items from the menu based on availability.
4. Analyze the menu to identify the cheapest and most expensive pizzas, and to cater to specific customer requests.
