# Carly's Clippers Project

In the Carly's Clippers project, you take on the role of a Data Analyst at Carlyâ€™s Clippers, the newest hair salon in town. Your task is to analyze data collected over the past few weeks to calculate key metrics that Carly can use for planning the business operations for the rest of the month.

## Data Provided

You are provided with three lists:

- `hairstyles`: Names of the haircuts offered.
- `prices`: Prices for each hairstyle.
- `last_week`: Number of each hairstyle sold last week.

Each index across these lists corresponds to a specific hairstyle, its price, and how many times it was purchased last week.

## Objective

## Tasks Overview

- Calculate the average price of a haircut.
- Reduce all haircut prices by $5.
