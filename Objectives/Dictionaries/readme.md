# Scrabble Project Overview

This project focuses on utilizing Python dictionaries to process and score a game of Scrabble among a group of friends. Through a series of tasks, learners will combine lists into dictionaries, calculate word scores, and tally game points, demonstrating proficiency in Python data structures and control flow.

## Features

- **Point Dictionary Creation**: Combines two lists into a dictionary mapping letters to their Scrabble point values, including handling for blank tiles.
- **Word Scoring Function**: Implements a function to calculate the total point value of a word based on individual letter scores.
- **Game Scoring**: Maps players to the words they've played and calculates total scores, updating a dictionary to reflect current standings.

## Learning Outcomes

- Manipulating lists and dictionaries to organize data.
- Defining functions with parameters to perform specific tasks.
- Using loops and conditional statements to iterate through data structures and calculate values.
- Practicing string manipulation and output formatting to display results.
