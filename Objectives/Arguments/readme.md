# The Nile Project Overview

This project aims to leverage Python functions and argument manipulation to streamline operations for a leading fulfillment agency.

## Features

- **Shipping Cost Calculation**: 
  - Develops a function to compute shipping costs based on coordinates and shipping type.
  - Utilizes tuples for coordinate handling and incorporates default parameters.
- **Driver Cost Calculation**:
  - Implements a function to identify the most cost-effective driver for a delivery.
  - Uses positional arguments and iterates through driver details to determine the lowest cost.
- **Revenue Calculation**:
  - Creates a function to calculate total revenue from multiple trips.
  - Utilizes keyword arguments to manage trip data and perform revenue computations.

## Learning Outcomes

- Function definition and parameter handling:
  - Writing functions with multiple parameters.
  - Utilizing default and arbitrary arguments.
- Tuple unpacking and argument manipulation:
  - Handling and unpacking tuples within functions.
  - Using the spread operator for function calls.
- Iteration and conditional logic:
  - Implementing loops and conditional statements to process data.
  - Calculating and comparing costs to determine optimal solutions.
- Revenue tracking and calculation:
  - Summing up values using loops.
  - Managing and processing keyword arguments to handle dynamic input.

## Detailed Task Breakdown

1. **calculate_shipping_cost() Function**:
   - **Parameters**: `from_coords`, `to_coords`, `shipping_type`.
   - **Functionality**: Unpacks coordinate tuples, calculates distance, retrieves shipping rate, and returns the formatted shipping cost.

2. **calculate_driver_cost() Function**:
   - **Parameters**: `distance`, and multiple `drivers`.
   - **Functionality**: Identifies the cheapest driver by calculating the cost based on distance, driver speed, and salary.

3. **calculate_money_made() Function**:
   - **Parameters**: Accepts any number of keyword arguments representing trips.
   - **Functionality**: Computes total revenue by iterating through trip details and summing up the profit.
