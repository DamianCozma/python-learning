# Getting Ready for Physics Class Project

This project is designed for learners to apply Python functions to solve problems related to basic physics concepts. By creating a series of functions, learners will calculate temperatures in different units, forces, energy, and work, using fundamental physics equations.

## Features

- **Temperature Conversion**: Implements functions to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- **Force Calculation**: Utilizes Newton's second law of motion to calculate force given mass and acceleration.
- **Energy Computation**: Calculates the energy of an object using its mass and the speed of light, demonstrating the relation \(E = mc^2\).
- **Work Determination**: Determines the work done by an object over a distance, integrating the concept of force over displacement.

## Learning Outcomes

- Applying mathematical operations in Python.
- Defining and calling functions with parameters and return values.
- Using default parameter values in functions.
- String concatenation and formatting for output.
