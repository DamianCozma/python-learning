### Gradebook Project

**Objective:** The Gradebook project is designed to give practical experience with Python lists, focusing on organizing and manipulating data. The project involves creating, modifying, and combining lists to manage a student's subjects and grades across different semesters. Key tasks include:

- Creating lists to store subjects and their corresponding grades.
- Combining subjects and grades into a two-dimensional list to form a gradebook.
- Modifying the gradebook by adding new subjects and grades, adjusting grades based on instructor feedback, and changing grading schemes for specific subjects.
- Combining the current semester's gradebook with a gradebook from a previous semester to create a comprehensive record of the student's academic performance.

This project emphasizes the use of list operations such as appending, removing, and accessing elements to manipulate data structures effectively.
