# Gradebook Project

The Gradebook project is a hands-on Python exercise focusing on lists, designed to simulate the management of a student's academic records. It provides practical experience with organizing and manipulating data through creating, modifying, and combining lists.

## Objective

To manage a student's subjects and grades across different semesters using Python lists, demonstrating proficiency in list operations and data manipulation.

## Key Features

- **List Creation**: Initiates lists to store subjects and their corresponding grades.
- **Two-Dimensional List**: Combines subjects and grades into a two-dimensional list, forming a comprehensive gradebook.
- **Gradebook Modification**: Includes adding new subjects and grades, adjusting existing grades based on instructor feedback, and altering grading schemes for specific subjects.
- **Semester Integration**: Merges the current semester's gradebook with a previous semester's records to create a full academic performance overview.

## Core Tasks

1. Create separate lists for subjects and grades.
2. Form a gradebook by combining these lists into a two-dimensional structure.
3. Modify the gradebook by:
   - Adding new subjects and grades.
   - Adjusting grades as necessary.
   - Changing grading schemes for particular subjects.
4. Combine the current semester's gradebook with one from a previous semester for a complete academic history.
